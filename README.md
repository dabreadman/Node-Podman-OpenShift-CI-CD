## Project specs
A containerised CI/CD pipeline for Kubernetes / OpenShift applications using GitOps
Develop a **persistent application** (in a language of your choice) that consists of a front-end component, a **back-end database** and (optionally) a **messaging system** (Redis, MQ, Kafka, etc). Set up a **CI/CD pipeline** to **BUILD, BAKE and DEPLOY** your application to a container platform using **GitOps methodologies** and approaches (fully automated deployment). Include **scanning of code** , **container images** and **production environments** for best practices and security purposes in your automated process.
