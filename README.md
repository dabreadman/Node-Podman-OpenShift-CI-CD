Set up a **CI/CD pipeline** to **BUILD, BAKE and DEPLOY** your application to a container platform using **GitOps methodologies** and approaches (fully automated deployment). Include **scanning of code** , **container images** and **production environments** for best practices and security purposes in your automated process.
